      <h2>Why This Foundation Was Created</h2>
      <p>The Niyitanga Aid Foundation was born out of love — love for a son whose story deserves to be told not in sorrow, but in service. This foundation was established to ensure that what was once a quiet story of loss becomes a powerful mission of healing and restoration. It stands to bring dignity, resources, and opportunity to children and families facing hardship — so that no struggle is carried alone, and every life is met with care.</p>
